# SVM-Visualizer
## Support Vector Machine Visualizer
This simple project provides a visual representation of support vector machine (SVM) classifier decision boundaries and their dynamic adjustments in response to changes in the dataset.

### Overview
The main.py file is the only component of this project. It generates an interactive plot showing the SVM decision boundaries. Users can drag and drop data points within the plot to observe real-time changes in the decision boundaries.

### Functionality
Visualization: The interactive plot displays decision boundaries of the SVM classifier.
Dynamic Adjustment: Users can modify the dataset by dragging and dropping points, enabling real-time updates of the decision boundaries.
